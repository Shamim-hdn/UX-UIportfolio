            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello! I'm Shamim Hadad, and my journey as a <b>UX/UI designer and developer</b> is rooted in a love for crafting experiences that resonate deeply with users.</p>
            <p>My adventure began at <b>Birmingham City University</b>, where I delved into the world of <b>UX design</b> through projects like Auto Space, Carbs Buddy, and Parent Hub. With the <b>Strong background in Front-End Development</b>, Each project was a chapter in my story, teaching me the value of empathy and user-centered design.</p>
            <p>Today, as a freelance website developer and designer, I continue to blend aesthetics with functionality. Every site I build is a testament to my belief that technology should serve and delight.</p>
            <p>Beyond design, I share my passion for self-improvement on two YouTube channels, where I explore ideas and tools that help people grow. Creating content in both English and Farsi, I connect with a global audience through storytelling and visual creativity.</p>
